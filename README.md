XTRAVIAN
========

Travian clone files of xtravian.eu server.

========

This source has been written by a lot of authors, such as Dzoki, advocaite, donn, Dixie, allkori etc.

I can call it 'my new work', because I am going to work on it and keep the clone going on, so that people
can use it for their own goods and believe, that clone will be completed someday.
